My personal presets for Ableton Live, mainly suit for ambient music.

System Requirements: Ableton Live 11.3+. Some presets may require additional plugins, I'll leave links.

Get the presets on [Github](https://github.com/feeshy/Racks4Live/). To install a preset, simply drag the `*.adg` file into the window of your Ableton Live.

## Audio Effect Racks

### Space

#### Orbit Dub

A reverb + delay effect with pitch drifting modulations. Wide range of adjustment, capable of sounding like a supernatural reverb or a vintage delay.

`Orbit Dub.adg` is built with core library devices of Live, while `Orbit Dub - Dirty` requiring [TAL-Dub-2](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-dub) and [Eventide Blackhole](https://www.eventideaudio.com/plug-ins/blackhole/) installed on your computer. The dirty version colors a more organic tone.

#### Dark Tails & Phaser Tails

*Dark Tails* is a reverb combined with a flanger, *Phaser Tails* is a reverb combined with a phaser. Both presets require [Sonic Anomaly Transpire](https://plugins4free.com/plugin/2777/).

Since the *Transpire* VST plugin is only available for Windows, there is an alternative version of *Dark Tails* that requires [Eventide Physion](https://www.eventideaudio.com/plug-ins/physion/) (1st gen, not the mk ii) instead. The physion version sounds almost the same as the transpire version to me, yet has much higher CPU comsumption.

#### Verb Fuzz

A reverb effect combined with the *Echo Fuzz* rack in the core library of Live.

#### Ducking Filterd Echo

A delay + reverb effect with a sidechain ducker and a resonant filter, adding THE MOVEMENT to your song. Sounds better at higher feedback value and with filter automations.

#### Filtered Reverb

A reverb effect combined with filters.

#### Vintage Delay

A simple delay with chorus and saturation, inspired by the classic DMM.
